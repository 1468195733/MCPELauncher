# MCPEFailLauncher: a custom Minecraft PE launcher for Android

MCPEFailLauncher is a custom Minecraft PE launcher that wraps around Minecraft PE and provides texture pack loading support.

Just choose Options on the main screen, then select a texture pack. It is that easy!

This program loads libminecraftpe.so from the currently installed copy of Minecraft PE, so it should be compatiable with the mod patching features of PocketTool and QuickPatch.

This version is *Alpha* and is for testing only. *There is a 5 minute timer on the binary release - after 5 minutes, the game shuts down.*

Known issues:
 - Xperia support not implemented
 - world date format not implemented
 - Options in the option screen not implemented
 - vibrate not implemented
